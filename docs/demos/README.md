# Video Showcase

As developers, the ability to collaborate through video is an essential part of our software workflow. Whether it's pair programming, demonstrating features, or reproducing bugs, video adds an extra layer of clarity to our communication. With the recent GitHub update, you can now upload .mp4 and .mov files directly to issues, pull requests, discussions, and more.

## Demo 1: Reproducing a Bug

Upload a video to help maintainers quickly understand and reproduce a reported bug.
